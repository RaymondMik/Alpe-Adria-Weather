# alpeadriaweather

Alpe Adria Weather is a simple web application for mobile devices developed with JavaScript and JQuery Mobile and built on top of the forecast.io. It provides realtime weather conditions of a number of locations throughout the Alpe Adria Region (Austria, Slovenia and North Eastern Italy) that I chose.
