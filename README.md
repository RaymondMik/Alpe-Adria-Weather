# alpeadriaweather

Alpe Adria Weather is a simple web application for mobile devices developed with JavaScript and JQuery Mobile and the data served by the forecast.io Rest API. It provides realtime weather conditions of my favourite locations throughout the Alpe Adria Region (Austria, Slovenia and North Eastern Italy).
